Hybrid Automation Framework

Tech Stack:
Java | Selenium WebDriver | TestNG | Maven | Apache POI (Excel Data Handling)

Project Overview

This project showcases a Hybrid Test Automation Framework that integrates modular, data-driven, and keyword-driven approaches to deliver scalable, maintainable, and robust automation testing for web applications.

The framework follows the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern, ensuring clear separation of test logic and element locators, which enhances reusability and simplifies test maintenance.

Key Automation Scenarios:-

Validation of Page URL and Page Title to ensure correct navigation and page rendering.

Login Functionality Testing â€“ includes both positive and negative test cases for credential validation.

Validation of Error Messages upon invalid login attempts to ensure proper user feedback.

Data-Driven Testing Implementation using Apache POI to dynamically handle multiple input combinations from Excel.

Profile Editing Workflow Automation including field updates, dropdown selections, and popup handling.

Availability and Schedule Update Automation validating dropdown and button interactions.

Window Handling and Blog Page Navigation including user actions in new tabs and returning to the home page.

Logout Validation ensuring proper session termination after user activity.

Highlights:-

Developed using industry-standard automation practices for better maintainability and scalability.

Implemented reusable modular components to minimize redundancy and maximize efficiency.

Enabled configuration-driven execution through property files and Maven profiles.

Leveraged TestNG annotations for parallel execution, grouping, and detailed reporting.

Integrated Excel-based Data Handling (Apache POI) for flexible and robust test input management.
